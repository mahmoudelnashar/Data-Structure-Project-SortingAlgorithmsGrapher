# Data-Structure-Project (Junior - Fall 2021)

- Team project
- Written in pyhton
- Implemented different sorting algorithms and compared between them

## Details

1. Ability to create test data files. Optionally test data files may be created using Microsoft Excel.
2. The user can choose either to compare the efficiency of an algorithm with another algorithm, or to compare an algorithm with its asymptotic efficiency.
3. Ability to select an algorithm out of predefined set of algorithms. A list of sort algorithm must include, but not limited to, the insertion sort, the merge sort, the bubble sort, the quick sort, and the heap sort.
4. The efficiency should be measured as the number of steps taken by the algorithm to sort the test data.
5. The results should by displayed graphically.
